        Breastfeeding can be really hard, especially for new moms. Even though
        exclusive breastfeeding is recommended by the doctors for at least the
        first six months of a baby's life, according to the statistics, only 41%
        of mothers manage to breastfeed their babies, and less than 1% goes on
        until the sixth month. In many cases the mother ends up blaming herself
        for "not being able to feed her baby", which can lead even to postpartum
        depression. But the truth is that, usually there are not enough
        information for the mother to achieve exclusive breastfeeding. This
        website, by no means, intends to replace doctors and midwives, but here
        you can exchange useful information for this journey and maybe get a
        support system that works for you. Just have in mind, that whatever the
        outcome is, what's important is that you keep your good health, mentally
        and physically and don't forget that happy mommy, leads to happy baby.
